# Algorithmic-Design

I really like creative and visual programming. This repository contains experiments I programmed and will be updated regularly, I hope you will enjoy!




I started to use the p5.js library (Processing) after discovering the amazing [Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) and his books [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com), some of my realizations are inspired by his work.
